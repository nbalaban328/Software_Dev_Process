📁 Final Project – Software Development Process @ Stevens Institute of Technology
This repository contains the final project I completed for the Software Development Process course at Stevens Institute of Technology. The project demonstrates end-to-end application of software engineering principles, including requirements analysis, design documentation, version control, team collaboration, implementation, testing, and Agile development practices.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used:

Agile methodology (Scrum)

UML diagrams & system modeling

Unit & integration testing

Code reviews and issue tracking

📄 Project Summary:
The objective is to implement a software with IoT into a reliable and readily available 
self-driving vehicle of the future. The development of the software will go into an 
embedded system with an emphasis on its real-time availability. Special features that 
this vehicle will highlight are dynamic cruise control, safety & leisure and satellite GPS 
navigation.

🚀 Purpose:
This project serves as a capstone to showcase practical application of software engineering techniques in a collaborative development environment.
